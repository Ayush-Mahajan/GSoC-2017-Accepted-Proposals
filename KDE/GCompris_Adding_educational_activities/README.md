# GCompris: Adding educational activities in Qt version of GCompris

### Project description

**Title**: Finishing started activities for GCompris in Qt-Quick

**Abstract**: GCompris is a high-quality educational suite which aims at making learning easier for children aged 2 to 10. GCompris currently has 137 activities on various topics such as science, maths, games with which it has successfully created a great learning environment for children. However, there are few activities which were started previously but is not yet complete. I strongly believe in what GCompris stands for and in this project, I aim at taking GCompris one step forward by finishing three started activities: Pilot a Submarine, Family and Digital Electronics.
